Predicting Claim frequencies in an Insurance firm

PROJECT OBJECTIVE : 

An Insurance firm providing tour insurance is facing higher claim frequency. The management decides to collect data from the past few years. The task is to make a model which predicts the claim status and provide recommendations to management using CART, RF & ANN and comparing the model's performances in train and test sets.

List of steps involved : 

•	Importing the dataset 
•	Descriptive Statistics and Null value check 
•	Data split into train and test 
•	Building Classification models – CART, Random Forest,  ANN  
•	Evaluating the Performance metrics 
•	Inference 

EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS : 

Insurance dataset contains 3000 observations with 9 predictors and 1 predictand. Claim status is the target variable which is to be predicted. The dataset contains factor, numeric and integer datatypes. No null values are present within the dataset. 

UNIVARIATE ANALYSIS : The nature, distribution and presence of outliers are assessed for each variable through graphs. Refer Business Report for the visualisations.

BIVARIATE ANALYSIS : The predictand is analysed for its pattern with each predictor variables and insights are drawn.
